PASSWORD GENERATOR 

Description: 
A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted. 

When the user initializes the process through clicking the button "Generate Password" they would see prompt for them to enter the number of characters the password should contain. If this is outside prescribed range of 10-64, the user would be prompted again enter a password length within the range. 
This process will carry on up to the point the user has entered a number that satisfies the condition. 

The password generator would then prompt the user to opt and include numbers; special characters; uppercase; and lowercase alphabets. The user is required to select at least one option in order for the process to conclude this stage. Only when this condition is met will the generator stop looping.

Once all the necessary conditions have been met, the random password will appear in the given password box.
